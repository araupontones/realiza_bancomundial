# Version 1

## Comments made by Andres

It is too slow because the app runs all the code since the begining 

## Changes made by Andres

### Architecture
I created a folder for each module in R/. The idea is that making changes is easier for everyone. And that a change in a specific module, does not affect any other part of the app.

### Data

The data is loaded only once at the begining of the app. Instead of loading it every time that a tab is active.
